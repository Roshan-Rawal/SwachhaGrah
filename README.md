# SwachhaGrah
An Android Application which created for the Swachhathon where people can find like minded people and contribute towards Swachh Bharat Mission by various activities

# This application was made for competition called Swachhatathon in which we have to submit our digital idea to support Swachh Bharat Mission.

In this people can connect with like minded other people and can perform various activites like campaign, railies and many more.
And all this information is also taken care in backend so government can also award them who is performing extra ordinary. So if more and more people come forward and make efforts towards this change then this app can help to bring a revolution through Swachh Bharat Mission


# I used Android Studio to build this application and Java as a programming language.
